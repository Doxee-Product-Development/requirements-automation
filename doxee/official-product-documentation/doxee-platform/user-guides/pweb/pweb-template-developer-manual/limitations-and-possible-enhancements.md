## Functional Limitations
- Chart's tooltip is one for all charts. It has two lines. Label goes as the first line, value goes as the second line. Possible enhancements are:

- ability to define what fields of data set should be shown in tooltip;

- ability to override general tooltip for any chart.

- Chart's legend. Now it can be placed to the top or to the right of a chart. Possible enhancements are:

- &nbsp;ability to add it to the left and to the bottom of the chart

- Charts interactivity for filtering data. Pie chart and donut chart with one ring (one series) can be interacted to filter data. Possible enhancements are:

- interactivity for other chart types

- Displaying filtered data on charts. Bar chart shows all data set and filtered subset in different color. Other charts show only filtered subset. Possible enhancements are:

- How should filtered subset be shown on other charts

- Setup maximum table rows number or height&nbsp;

- There are several limitations of external components (charts, grid, frameworks), including known bugs and UI issues

## UI/Mobile Limitations
- Absence of standard for desktop interactions: no mouse-over, lack of accurate dragging, etc.

- Variety of non-standard behaviours for different interactivity related to rotating, zooming, drag-scrolling and other.
