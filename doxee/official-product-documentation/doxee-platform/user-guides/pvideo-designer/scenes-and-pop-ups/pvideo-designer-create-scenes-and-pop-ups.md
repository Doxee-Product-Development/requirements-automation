New scenes and pop-ups are created in the **Project editor sidebar**. From there, they can be drag-and-dropped into the editing area of the Storyboard editor.

To create a new scene:

- **Navigate to the Projects tab and open a Project**. This action automatically opens the Storyboard editor, and the first Storyboard in the Project is displayed.

- **Click the plus icon** in the left sidebar to add a scene.

- Alternatively, **open the arrow menu** and click **New scene**.

To create a new pop-up:

- **Navigate to the Projects tab and open a Project**. This action automatically opens the Storyboard editor, and the first Storyboard in the Project is displayed.

- **Open the arrow menu** in the left sidebar and click **New popup**.

The newly created scene or pop-up will be added to the sidebar and can be used in a Storyboard.

### FAQ
#### What is the difference between scenes and pop-ups?
Scenes and pop-ups are the basic building blocks of interactive videos and can contain the same elements. However, pop-ups can only be integrated into the timeline of an interactive video by mapping them to CTA buttons.
