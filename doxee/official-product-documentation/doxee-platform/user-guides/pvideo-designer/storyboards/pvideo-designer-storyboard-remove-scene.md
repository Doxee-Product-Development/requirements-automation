Scenes and pop-ups can be removed from the Storyboard in the following ways:

- **Through the three-dot menu**

- **With the keyboard**

**Through the three-dot menu:**

- **Open the Storyboard** from which you want to remove the scene or pop-up.

- **Locate the scene** or pop-up you want to remove and click the **three-dot menu** &gt; **Remove**.

**With the keyboard:**

- **Open the Storyboard** from which you want to remove the scene or pop-up.

- **In the Storyboard, select the scene** or pop-up you want to remove. The selected element will receive a blue outline to indicate that the cursor focus is currently set on it.

- **Press the *Delete* key**.

In both cases, the scene or pop-up will be removed from the Storyboard together with its connections to other elements.
