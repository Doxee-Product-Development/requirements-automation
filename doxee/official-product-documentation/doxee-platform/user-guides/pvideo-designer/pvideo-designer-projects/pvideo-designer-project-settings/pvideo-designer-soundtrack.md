The soundtrack is a default audio track that will play throughout the entire video. It can be used as the baseline audio, for example white noise, and layered with other audio tracks or TTS from individual scenes.

To set a soundtrack for a Project:

- Open the **Project settings** &gt; **Layout &amp; Sound** and scroll to the section **Soundtrack**.

- In the drop-down field, search for and select an audio file. You can preview the track by clicking the play button next to the file name.

- Adjust the soundtrack volume by clicking the audio button and using the slider.

- Remove the soundtrack by clicking the cross button.

> Custom soundtrack

It’s possible to upload a custom audio file and add it as an option for the soundtrack drop-down menu. To do this, open the **Project settings** &gt; **Layout &amp; Sound **and navigate to the section **Soundtrack**. Click the **Upload new** button and select an audio file (*.mp3) from your device. The custom soundtrack will be available as an option in the drop-down menu for soundtrack selection.

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a technology which allows to convert written text to be converted to spoken words. Doxee Platform® offers innovative, AI-powered TTS features in its Pvideo Designer solution.
