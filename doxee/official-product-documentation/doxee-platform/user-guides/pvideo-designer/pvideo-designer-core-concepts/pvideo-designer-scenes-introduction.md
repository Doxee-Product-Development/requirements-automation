**Scenes **and **pop-ups** are individual video clips that make up the basic building blocks of every interactive video. A single scene may serve as a self-contained interactive video, or it can be connected to other scenes and pop-ups to form a user-guided video flow. Scenes and pop-ups are shared elements of the entire Project, which means that each scene or pop-up can be used in multiple Storyboards within that same Project. This ensures consistency of brand identity and quality of communication.

Scenes and pop-ups can be added in the sidebar of the Project editor. To add the typical video elements, such as background, text, and audio, open the scene or pop-up in the video editor.

### FAQ
#### What is the difference between scenes and pop-ups?
Scenes and pop-ups are the fundamental building blocks of interactive videos and can contain similar elements such as background video, TTS audio, animated layouts, and other elements. However, pop-ups can only be integrated into the flow of an interactive video by mapping them to CTA buttons.

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a technology which allows to convert written text to be converted to spoken words. Doxee Platform® offers innovative, AI-powered TTS features in its Pvideo Designer solution.
