Interactive videos may include dynamic elements such as names, addresses, or dates. During video creation, these elements are inserted as placeholders and linked to the corresponding fields in the input file through **Mapping schemas**. At runtime, the placeholders are resolved into the actual data from the input file and inserted into the finalized Pvideo.
