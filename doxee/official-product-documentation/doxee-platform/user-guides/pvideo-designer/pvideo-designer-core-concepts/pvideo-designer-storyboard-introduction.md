A Storyboard is a subentity of the Project. It’s a flow of individual scenes and pop-ups that are connected either synchronously or asynchronously through user actions. One Pvideo Project can have multiple Storyboards that are composed of a shared collection of scenes and pop-ups. Each Storyboard may serve a different user persona or business scenario, depending on the purpose of the interactive video.

Each Storyboard has a universal unique system identifier or **UUID**, which takes the form of an immutable alphanumeric string, for example, `90051859-a1c4-4d79-ae00-830b5cc05597`. The UUID may be used in various configurations, for example, when indicating the specific Storyboard to use for the final interactive video.
