Video Designer Projects are the core entities of Video Designer. A Project is a video template consisting of **scenes** and **pop-ups** which are connected either through logic based on the mapped input data, or through direct user interactions within the video, for example, call to action (CTA) buttons. The individual scenes may contain video and audio clips, animations, text, images, and interactive elements, all of which can be inserted and edited in the video editor.

Each Project has a universal unique system identifier or **UUID**, which takes the form of an immutable alphanumeric string, for example, `90052299-a1c4-4d79-ae00-830b5cc05597`. The UUID may be used in various configurations, for example, when embedding a Project in a workflow.

Video Designer is a web-based video editing tool for creating interactive videos. It boasts a variety of innovative AI-powered features like script writing and text-to-speech (TTS). Video Designer is Doxee’s native solution for creating interactive videos and can be integrated seamlessly into the larger Doxee Platform® workflow ecosystem to cover the entire lifecycle of interactive videos from creation to delivery and archiving.
