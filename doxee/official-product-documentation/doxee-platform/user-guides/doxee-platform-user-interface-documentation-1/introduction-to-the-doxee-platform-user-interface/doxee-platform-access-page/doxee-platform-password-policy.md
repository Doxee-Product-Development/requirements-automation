The password policy for local Doxee Platform users is as follows:

- Minimum length 12 characters

- At least 1 uppercase letter

- At least 1 lowercase letter

- At least 1 number

- At least 1 special character (i.e. any character that is not a number or a letter)

- The password must be different from the last 24 passwords used.

- The password cannot be the same as the username.

> Important

The password is valid for 90 days, after which the system will ask you to set a new one at the next login.

After 3 failed login attempts, the account is temporarily blocked for 15 minutes.
