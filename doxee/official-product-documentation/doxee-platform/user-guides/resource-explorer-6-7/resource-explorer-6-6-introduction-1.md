Resource Explorer is a graphical tool for accessing files and folders on a WebDAV server (like the Doxee Content Repository) and on the local file system. It is available as a stand-alone tool and is also embedded in Template Designer and Process Designer.

Use Resource Explorer to move files between the file system and your servers, make backups, restore data, and manage versions and access rights of your remote files.
