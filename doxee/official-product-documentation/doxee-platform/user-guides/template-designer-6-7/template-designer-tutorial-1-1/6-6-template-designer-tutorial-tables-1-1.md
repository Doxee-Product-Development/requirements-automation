## Introduction
In this chapter we introduce the use of tables in the *Doxee Template Designer*. We assume that you have explored the *Palette *and got familiar with the *Outline *and the *Properties View*.

## Step by Step
### Inserting a blank table
First insert another empty *Block*. Select a *Table *element in the *Palette *and drag it to your template. A dialog where the number of columns, number of rows and column width can be provided. For this example set 3 columns and 2 rows, leave the column width field empty and click on *OK*. A blank table [`2: For more information about table structures see the user guide`] with 3 columns and 2 rows is inserted. You can now modify the structure of your table. This can be done in multiple ways – by using the *context menu*, via the *Properties View *or *graphically *using the mouse.

The structure of a *Table *is defined by its *columns*. These can be selected in the *Outline View*. Their width can either be modified using the mouse in the Design Window or numerically and precisely using *Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; Table &gt; column-width*. Further rows and columns can be inserted via the context menu. This can be done both in the *Designer *window and in the *Outline View*.

### Basic Layout
Modify the table as following:

**4 Columns**

Click anywhere in the table (*Design Window *or *Outline View*) and select *Insert &gt; Column after *or *Column before *in the context menu. A column before or after is inserted. [`3: Please note that the structure of a table is defined by the columns. These can be found in the Table Columns node in the Outline View`]

**Full page width**

The initial column width can be altered by selecting one or more columns in the *Outline View *and applying *Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; Table &gt; column-width: *36 mm. Adapt the value accordingly to fit the table width to the page width. It is also possible to select the columns in the *Outline View *and drag either column to the desired width in the *Design Window*.

**Rows**

Click any row or cell and select *Insert &gt; Row after *or *Row before *in the context menu. Repeat this to add more rows.

**Merge first row**

In order to merge cells, select a cell in the *Outline View *or the *Design Window *and select *Merge with &gt; left/right cell(s) *or respectively *cell(s) above/below *in the context menu. Alternatively it is possible to delete 3 cells and apply *Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; Table &gt; number-columns-spanned*: 4 to the remaining cell.

You can now populate your table with further content, e.g. text or images and apply custom formatting. When you are done, create another PDF preview.

## Things to Try
- Enter some text to the first row and format it as you like

- Insert a *Table Header *or *Table Footer *using the context menu or via the Palette

- Create advanced layouts or structures using tables

- Insert images or text and structure these

- Go on experimenting with the layout and the structure of the table, e.g. add further rows or columns

- Take a look at the behaviour of tables which go over multiple pages with and without *Table Headers *and/or *Table Footers *in the PDF preview

 p[data-block-id] {font-size:1rem;} ul li p[data-block-id] {margin-bottom: 0;} ul[data-type="taskList"] li div p[data-block-id] {margin-bottom: 0;} ol li p[data-block-id] {margin-bottom: 0;} table tbody th p[data-block-id] { margin-bottom: 0;} blockquote p[data-block-id] {margin-bottom: 0 !important;}  p[data-block-id]:empty::after {content: "\00A0";}
