Doxee Template Designer is a graphical tool for creating and editing templates, which can be used by the Doxee Process Engine to generate documents. Template Designer supports the user in layouting and formatting static and dynamic content in order to create (mostly page- based) documents.

This document includes an installation guide, a quick-start guide providing a short overview of the basic features and a detailed description of the complete functionality. Some features of Infinica templates, which are supported by Template Designer, influence features of other Doxee components, such as Process Engine, Composer, and Workplace. For further information about these products, consult their respective documentation documents.

The main window in Template Designer is called workbench and consists of a menu bar and a toolbar at the top, an editor and a variable number of optional views. The editor is described in [Editor](/doxee-platform/docs/6-6-template-designer-user-guide-editor-1-1), the views are listed and explained in [Views](/doxee-platform/docs/views-1), the available elements are listed and described in [Elements](/doxee-platform/docs/6-6-template-designer-user-guide-elements-1-1), and all the functionalities available via the menus or the toolbars are summarized in [Actions](https://docs.doxee.com/docs/6-6-template-designer-user-guide-actions-1-1).
