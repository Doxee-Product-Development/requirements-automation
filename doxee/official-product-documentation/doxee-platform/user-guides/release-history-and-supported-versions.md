**Fully supported** versions receive regular updates, including fixes of software bugs and security vulnerabilities. Fixes are released as soon as possible as a service pack for the affected version only. 

**Partially supported **versions receive only updates with fixes for critical problems. Doxee will try to find workarounds that do not require product changes wherever possible. After this date, when partial support expires, versions will go in **End-of-Life (EOL) **and will be unsupported, meaning that will no longer receive updates; therefore, there is no guarantee that problems can be solved without migrating to a newer supported version.
