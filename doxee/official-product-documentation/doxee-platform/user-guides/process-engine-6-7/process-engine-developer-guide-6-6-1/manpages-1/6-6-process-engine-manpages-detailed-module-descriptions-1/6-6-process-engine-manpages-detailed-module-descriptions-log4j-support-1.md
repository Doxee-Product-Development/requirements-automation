Logging via Log4j 2.

Logger:	

log4j

This module provides logging via Apache's Log4j 2 library. This allows the Process Engine log to use advanced logging features like log file rotation and various output targets (appenders).

For Log4j logging, the Process Engine's logging configuration contains one or more appender configurations in Log4's configuration format. Additional Log4j libraries may be required on the classpath for extended Logj features.

For more information about Log4j's capabilities and configuration, please refer to the official documentation:[https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/)
