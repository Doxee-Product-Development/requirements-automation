Process Engine is a software solution for defining and executing processes. Processes are graph based programs, similar to scripts but designed to be easily editable with visual tools.Processes perform most operations by executing activities, which are predefined program elements designed for specific tasks like reading and writing files, rendering templates or sending emails. For most use cases, users can design processes by simply arranging existing activities and combining them with input data, although it is possible to provide custom activities for more custom solutions.

Processes are defined in Infinica Process Definition (IPD) files and stored alongside the Process Engine installation. Users and clients can then call the Process Engine to execute these processes through a variety of interfaces, including command line, SOAP and embedded Java interfaces.

Workplace uses the Process Engine to execute its business cases, allowing processes to contain human tasks which allow users to interact with processes by filling out web based forms.

This document provides describes how to install and configure the Process Engine. For information on how to use the Process Engine please refer to the User Guide. For specific details on how to create process definitions, please see the Process Definition Reference.
