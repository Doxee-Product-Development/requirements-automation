Business Designer is a graphical tool in the form of web application for creating and editing templates, which can be used by the Process Engine to generate documents. Business Designer supports the user in layouting and formatting static and dynamic content in order to create (mostly page-based) documents. This document includes an installation and configuration guide. Since Business Designer is a web application most of the configuration is done on the server. Some features of Doxee templates, which are supported by Business Designer, influence features of other Doxee products, such as Process Engine, Composer, and Workplace. In similar way some of the features of Business Designer depend on other Doxee products, such as Doxee Content Repository or Composer. For further information about these products, consult their respective documentation documents.

Generally Business Designer provides accessible user friendly way to edit Doxee templates stored in Doxee Content Repository and to preview these templates for example as PDF or in Composer - therefore it depends on these applications and needs to be properly set up and integrated with them.

## About User Guide
