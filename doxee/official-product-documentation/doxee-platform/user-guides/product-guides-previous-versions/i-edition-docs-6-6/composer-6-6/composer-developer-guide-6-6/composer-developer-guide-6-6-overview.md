Navigate to other release versions of Doxee Platform Composer

[6.6](https://docs.doxee.com/docs/en/composer-6-6)

[6.7](https://docs.doxee.com/docs/en/composer-6-7)

The Composer (in the initial versions called "Composer 2nd Gen") is a web-based document editor for ITX document templates which enables users to edit rule-based documents.

Functionalities are mainly translated from the Composer 1st Generation with an extension of new functionalities which are only available in the Composer 2nd Generation (in this documentation called Composer).

The Composer was developed in two forms: Standalone version and Workplace integrated version, which would act as Human Task inside the Workplace process.

## About the Developer Guide
This developer guide is also part of the help section inside the Composer Application, which consists of chapters explaining the features and the user interaction with the application.

All the rules and behaviors that need to be configured inside the template can be found inside the user guides of Business Designer and Template Designer.

> Important

A certain level of knowledge about the related Doxee applications, mainly Content Repository and Business Designer, is required in order to be able to set up Composer. To find out more about these applications, please consult their respective documentation pages.
