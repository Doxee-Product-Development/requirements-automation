[6.6](https://docs.doxee.com/docs/en/composer-6-6)

[6.7](https://docs.doxee.com/docs/en/composer-6-7)

With extensive use of the Composer, you will likely notice quickly the large number of units, which are available for the input of length dimensions. When several different units are supported for a definable length, you will find next to the input field a drop-down list with the available units.

These are the current ones:

- Millimeter

- Centimeter

- Points

- Inch

- Pixels

If there are several length-related inputs in a dialog, you are free to choose any unit for each input field. For example, you could use the millimeter unit for the page width and centimeters or inches for the page height.
