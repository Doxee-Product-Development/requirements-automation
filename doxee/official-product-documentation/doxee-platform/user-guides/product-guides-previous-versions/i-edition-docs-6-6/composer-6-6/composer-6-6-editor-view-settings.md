The document editor can be customized with several view settings to aid in the editing process or declutter the workspace. To activate or deactivate these layers, open the **View** menu in the bottom left corner of the editor and select from the following options:

- **Show table borders:** Adds a dotted outline to invisible table borders

- **Show editable regions:** Adds a blue background to all template elements that can be edited in Composer

- **Show non-editable regions:** Adds a grey background to all template elements that have been locked by the designer and can’t be edited in Composer

- **Show manual page breaks:** Shows manually inserted page breaks in the document

- **Show precise page breaks:** Shows the approximate positions of page breaks

> Note

The calculation of page breaks is based on the current contents of the document. After it has been rendered into a paginated file, the actual page breaks may be different due to dynamically resolved contents, for example Optional Content or External Documents.

- **Show loading indicators:** Shows a loading indicator in the top left corner, for example when the application is loading images at start-up or recalculating page breaks during the editing process

- **Show track changes indicators:** Adds a visual indicator to edited elements

- **Show empty text markers:** Shows indicators for text elements that have no content

- **Show image dimensions:** Shows the dimensions of [Image](/doxee-platform/docs/composer-6-6-image-element) elements (in px)
