The Doxee Composer is a web application used to edit and process document templates which have been created with Doxee Business Designer into finished documents. These documents can be letters, customer contracts, registration documents, personalized advertising messages, invoices, bank statements etc. The advantages of the product lie in the comfortable embedding of reusable text blocks, in the flexible editing and formatting of unprotected regions, and in the integration of external data sources from which documents and building blocks can be assembled with all available input data (XML).

The Composer is part of the Doxee solutions for creating and distributing printable and electronic business communication. The Composer enables you to preview, edit, approve and finalize individualized documents created from a template. These documents are then usually rendered into a final output form like PDF or DOCX and further processed (sent, archived, printed).

The following descriptions will show you how to use the Composer by describing the available functionality and the associated concepts.

This document is based on the standard core functionality of the Composer. Depending on the configuration, some functions can be deactivated or others can be added, which will not be described here. Likewise, the behavior of individual building blocks cannot be explained, since these are usually constructed very specifically and fulfill a variety of functions, each according to differing application needs.
