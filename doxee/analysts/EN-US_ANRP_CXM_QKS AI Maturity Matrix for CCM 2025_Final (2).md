# Executive Summary

AI is emerging as a powerful experience orchestrator in customer communications. It turns isolated messages into journey-aware interactions that are measurable, explainable, and outcome-focused. As a persistent communication layer, AI accelerates personalized content creation, improves quality and compliance, and selects the best channel and moment by connecting to events and data. This white paper examines how the shift to AI-orchestrated experiences is unfolding inside modern Customer Communication Management (CCM) platforms, where AI-assisted authoring, content intelligence, and event-aware delivery turn static documents into timely interactions that help a customer complete the next step. Our research also surfaces the systemic hurdles that slow transformation, including template sprawl, fragmented data, limited real-time decisioning, and the need for transparent governance in regulated environments. We examine how leading platforms address these issues with open APIs, native journey mapping and analytics, strong compliance controls, and deployment choices that preserve security and data residency while accelerating change.

The centerpiece of our analysis is the Quadrant Knowledge Solutions' (QKS) AI Maturity Matrix for CCM, a framework that evaluates vendors on depth of AI capabilities, productization, adoption signals, and clarity of roadmap. Using this lens, we map providers across four stages - from AI Explorers to Industry Pioneers. The landscape shows clear separation. Many vendors are still piloting narrow features, while a select group has scaled AI across authoring, content rationalization, delivery, and analytics with roadmaps that connect CCM to broader customer experience (CX) programs. Within the QKS AI Maturity Matrix, Quadient is recognized as the industry's Most Valuable Pioneer for leading the shift from customer communications to intelligent interactions that take CCM to CXM transformation to a new level. The Quadient Inspire platform provides business users with prompt-based authoring, real-time sentiment tuning, and automated multilingual translation, then uses event and data signals with automatic channel failover to keep journeys moving. Open APIs and AnyPrem deployment across Software as a Service (SaaS), private cloud, hosted managed cloud, and on-premises place communications at the center of the customer experience (CX) stack.

CCM is no longer a back-office automated document generation system managed in a silo by specialized IT teams. Today, it's a core part of the CX technology stack that aligns marketing, service, operations, legal, and IT around a shared communications

strategy with journey whiteboards, co-authoring, and real-time insights. As the bridge between ERP, marketing automation, and CRM, CCM platforms use events and trusted data to trigger the next message and keep context across channels while honoring preference and consent. Modern CCM is designed for business users first, so authors personalize, translate, and check quality while IT governs scale and security. Leaders are moving to unified CCM platforms to not only strengthen compliance and reduce costs, but to raise customer satisfaction and journey completion.

Technology buyers evaluating modern CCM platforms should prioritize solutions that align with business outcomes, expose open integration for data and decisioning, and enforce robust guardrails for responsible AI. Plan for a staged path that pairs content rationalization with event integration so value lands early and scales safely. Looking ahead to 2028, we expect AI-orchestrated experiences to become the default, with author co-pilots, explainable next-best actions, and coordinated workflows across service, marketing, and operations. The result is a communication layer that consistently advances customer journeys while meeting the highest bar for security and compliance.

# Beyond CCM to CXM Transformation: The New Era of AIOrchestrated Communication Experiences

Customer Communication Management is moving from the generation of compliant output to the orchestration of intelligent communication experiences. The new benchmark is an AI-assisted, journey-aware model that blends content intelligence, realtime decisioning, and strict governance. Communications are rapidly authored, checked for tone, readability, and sensitive data, then delivered through the best channel with automatic delivery route optimization based on orchestration logic and real-time events. When CCM connects to events in core systems and to journey analytics, each message becomes a moment that advances an outcome such as activation, payment, or renewal. QKS Group's 2025 AI Maturity Matrix reveals three clear strengths in the market. Some vendors excel at deep content intelligence and legacy modernization. Others stand out for cloud scale and operational agility. A third group closes the loop between CCM and wider CX by aligning orchestration, data, and deployment choice, while the Most Valuable Pioneer exemplifies strength in all three. Buyers should expect shorter change cycles, fewer templates, higher journey completion, and clearer auditability when these three elements come together in a modern, AI-driven CCM platform.

# Challenges in CCM Modernization and Journey Alignment

Modernization is often slowed by template sprawl, hard coded rules, and fragmented repositories. Many estates still separate print and digital, which multiplies maintenance effort and creates inconsistent language across channels. Data needed for personalization sits in different systems and is not available in real time. Decisioning is limited to static rules, so the next step in a journey is not adjusted when a customer stalls or switches channel. Governance must keep pace with AI. Regulated industries need transparent controls for privacy, consent, retention, and explainability. Cloud adoption brings its own choices. Some programs require on-premises or private cloud for residency and control, while others prefer multi-tenant SaaS for speed. The result is a need for platforms that are API-first, event-aware, and flexible in deployment so that change can happen without disruption to compliance or operations.

# Agentic AI: The Foundation of Next-Gen Customer Experience Management (CXM)

Agentic AI in communications refers to systems that perceive context, decide the next action, and execute with safeguards. It begins with content intelligence that can ingest and rationalize large libraries, recommend clearer wording, translate consistently, and detect sensitive information. It continues with decisioning that selects message, timing, and channel based on events and observed behavior, with human override and a full audit trail. It is supported by an operating model for AI that covers approvals, versioning, telemetry, and quality evaluation. Finally, it is enabled by an open architecture that connects to core applications and data, and by deployment options that satisfy security and residency without slowing delivery. Programs that pair content rationalization with event-driven delivery show the fastest value. Over the next three to five years, the leaders will extend this foundation with author co-pilots, explainable decisioning, and agent workflows that coordinate steps across service, marketing, and operations. The destination is a communication layer that is intelligent, safe, and measurable, and that consistently moves journeys forward to achieve better outcomes in less time.

# The QKS AI Maturity Matrix: Framework for CCM Evaluation

To assess vendors in a fast-changing CCM market, QKS developed the AI Maturity Matrix for customer communication platforms. The framework evaluates how deeply AI is embedded across the content and delivery lifecycle and how clearly each vendor is steering toward AI-orchestrated communication experiences. It serves as both a scorecard and roadmap, showing how AI-first and production-ready a platform's AI capabilities are, and giving buyers a structured way to compare offerings.

# Primary Evaluation Criteria

- AI-First Productization: We examine whether AI is native across the communication chain: content ingestion and rationalization, authoring assistance, readability and sentiment checks, personally identifiable information (PII) detection, multilingual translation, intelligent testing and evaluation, and headless APIs that allow customers to use their preferred models. We also look at ease of configuration, quality of guardrails, and how AI supports both batch and interactive communications without workarounds.
- AI Vision & Roadmap: We assess the clarity and ambition of each vendor's plan for the next three to five years. Signals include investment levels, the pace of releasing meaningful AI features, a plan for explainable decisioning, partnerships in the AI ecosystem, and how well the vendor connects AI with business outcomes such as activation, payment, and renewal. Governance is a core part of vision, including model controls, auditability, privacy, and regulatory alignment for sectors such as banking and healthcare.
- Operational Hardening and Customer Impact: We evaluate proof at scale. Evidence includes enterprise references, measurable outcomes, and the maturity of the operating model around AI. We look for real-time orchestration with event triggers and channel optimization, performance at high volumes, uptime and resilience, deployment flexibility across on-premises, private cloud, and SaaS, depth of integrations with customer relationship management (CRM) or journey platforms, and the quality of telemetry and cost controls.

Using these criteria, QKS analysts rate each vendor on a normalized scale and plot them on the maturity matrix. The QKS AI Maturity Matrix categorizes vendors into four stages of maturity:

- Industry Pioneers: Leaders that excel across all dimensions. Their platforms offer advanced content intelligence, real-time orchestration tied to journeys, strong governance, and flexible deployment. They have pioneering customers in production and continue to introduce firsts, such as author co-pilots and explainable decisioning embedded into the day-to-day work of business users.
- Scaling for Impact: Vendors deploying AI at breadth and depth across use cases with consistent return on investment (ROI). AI is a standard part of composition, approval, delivery, and analytics. Features are ready to use, integrated with core components, and backed by multiple enterprise references that show faster change cycles, cost reduction, and higher journey completion.
- Building Momentum: Platforms that have moved beyond pilots with a handful of strong AI capabilities in production, typically in content rationalization, translation, readability, or targeted real-time triggers. Roadmaps are credible but not yet comprehensive, and decisioning is present in limited scenarios.
- AI Explorers: Early adopters offering basic AI assistance or isolated integrations with limited outcomes so far. Effort is focused on learning and pilots, with few references at scale and a roadmap that is still forming.

The QKS AI Maturity Matrix blends strategic intent with demonstrated capability. It cuts through the hype by grounding the assessment in shipped features, production evidence, and governance readiness while also considering each vendor's ability to keep pace with emerging AI techniques. With this framework, technology buyers can see where vendors stand today and how resilient their choices will be as CCM shifts to AIorchestrated communication experiences.

Journeys are designed once and bound to approved content blocks and live data. The composable core is headless and API-first, which means the same business logic can serve a web portal, a mobile app, a printed package, or a partner application without rebuilding anything. Customer-facing experiences such as conversational interfaces, intelligent forms, and preference centers let users complete tasks, change channels, and keep context as they move as they move across journeys and channels.

An AI layer improves quality and timing at each step to orchestrate intelligent interactions with measurable outcomes. Predictive models guide next actions, sentiment checks inform tone, automated document processing accelerates composition, and the platform selects the best channel and moment for delivery with full audit trail. The document processing layer then collects data, composes the output, and distributes it at scale. Every interaction and communication is stored in an archive, engagement signals flow back into analytics, and journeys are tuned continuously. This is how applications move from one-way output to interactive experiences that measurably advance activation, payment, renewal, and other critical next steps in the customer journey.

# Comparative Analysis of Vendors in the QKS AI Maturity Matrix

Each CCM vendor brings a distinct approach to AI-enabled communications, with different strengths and focus areas. Below are brief comparative insights on the other vendors in our analysis, positioned relative to Quadient as the top leader:

- Messagepoint: Its MARCIE engine performs advanced semantic analysis, similarity detection, plain language rewriting, sensitive term discovery, and multilingual translation that non-technical authors can apply inside everyday work. The company's roadmap continues to deepen GenAI for content quality, migration acceleration, and governed reuse at scale. Because the platform is oriented to content intelligence rather than journey decisioning, and operates with a more focused ecosystem, its position is slightly lower on AI vision breadth than peers that span end to end orchestration.
- Smart Communications: Smart Communications runs a cloud-native platform on AWS with proven scale in regulated industries. It shows strong enterprise readiness in multi-tenant operations, security, and global programs, with rich connectors into core insurance and banking systems. The vendor's CXM posture is to serve as the communication execution core that plugs into customer data and journey tools, which deliver measurable impact at volume. Content intelligence is

improving, but not as deep as specialists, and deeper journey decisioning typically comes through partners.

- OpenText: OpenText Exstream sits within a broad enterprise content and analytics estate that brings strength in archival, records, and complex integration. The company is rolling AI across the portfolio through its cloud services, adding assisted authoring, extraction, and analytics while maintaining the high-volume document engines that large enterprises rely on. This gives OpenText credible scores for scalability, governance, and ecosystem reach. At the same time, dayto-day authoring assistance and native GenAI depth are less pervasive than content intelligence specialists, and program complexity can slow visible innovation at the edge.
- Doxee: Doxee focuses on digital engagement with strong personalized video and interactive experiences. AI is used to tailor content and guide next-best interactions inside web and mobile flows, which shows real impact at the program level. The platform runs at scale in European markets and integrates analytics for journey improvement. Its scope is narrower for complex regulated document composition, which keeps its AI maturity to the right but short of the pioneer cluster.
- Intense: UniServe CCM has strong adoption in telecom and banking across APAC and the Middle East. The platform supports event-triggered communications and uses AI for classification and targeted personalization. Delivery and deployment options are proven, which lifts customer impact. Content intelligence and journey decisioning are moderate, and global references are fewer, so the placement is lower within this quadrant.
- Newgen: Newgen blends process and content with wide use in onboarding and service communications. Machine learning is applied to classification, extraction, and compliance checks, and there are solid production references in regulated sectors. Authoring depth and advanced content intelligence are lighter, and orchestration is mostly rule based. The result is credible impact with steady AI adoption, positioned in the lower half of Scaling for Impact.

QKS Al Maturity Matrix™

- Precisely: EngageOne benefits from strong data quality and address validation heritage that improves deliverability and targeting. AI is present around data enrichment and document handling, and the platform serves large batch programs with dependable operations. Native AI for composition and journey alignment is more limited, and module cohesion varies, which justifies a lower quadrant position despite meaningful customer impact.
- Elixir: Elixir serves print-centric and service provider estates with reliable batch composition. AI features are emerging, and journey alignment is limited, though modernization paths exist for digital extensions. Operational stability is solid, but AI productization and CXM breadth are still maturing, which fits the Building Momentum placement.
- Sefas: Sefas has composition strength for high-volume print and postal workflows, including legacy formats. AI maturity and interactive or web-first experiences are limited and often require custom projects. Cloud options are narrower, so the platform shows steady but incremental progress, matching a Building Momentum position.
- Nintex: Nintex is known for rapid workflow automation and strong ties to Microsoft environments. AI assists with process mapping and recommendations, and there is basic document generation for simple correspondence. Native CCM depth for complex regulated scenarios is light, so AI maturity for CXM is growing rather than scaled, which places Nintex in this band.
- Kwsoft: Kwsoft focuses on structured forms and public sector use cases in its home markets. Deployments are often on-premises with strong localization, but AI productization for content intelligence, real-time decisioning, and orchestration is early. Global references are limited, which places the vendor in the exploratory stage on AI maturity and vision.

# Strategic Guidance for Technology Buyers

In the age of AI-augmented Customer Communications Management (CCM), technology buyers must navigate a new set of priorities to deliver an exceptional Customer Experience (CX). Modern CCM platforms are far more than document generators - they are AI-driven, omnichannel engagement hubs that tie into broader digital experience ecosystems. Buyers across large enterprises, mid-market firms, and public sector agencies share common goals (personalization, efficiency, compliance), but each segment faces unique considerations. Below, we provide strategic guidance tailored to each, highlighting how to leverage AI augmentation, composable architecture, omnichannel delivery, strict compliance, and legacy modernization in alignment with your overall CX and digital transformation strategies.

# Large Enterprises: Embracing AI-Driven, Composable Platforms at Scale

Large enterprises often grapple with fragmented communication systems across business units and geographies, making a unified CX vision challenging. Breaking down organizational silos and legacy barriers is essential to transforming customer communications into a strategic CX asset.

- Leverage AI for Scale and Efficiency: Prioritize vendors that lead in AI maturity and have a clear innovation roadmap. Advanced AI capabilities can drastically reduce template design and maintenance effort, as shown by tools that analyze and consolidate duplicate content across thousands of templates. Such AI-driven template rationalization not only cuts IT workload and costs, but also accelerates time-to-market, a critical advantage at enterprise scale. Buyers should evaluate each vendor's AI 'readiness,' for example, some CCM providers are already industry pioneers in AI integration, offering features like intelligent content generation, real-time sentiment adjustment, and automated translation.
- Composable Architecture & Integration: Large organizations typically have complex IT landscapes. Ensure the CCM solution supports a composable architecture, i.e. it can function as a modular component in your broader CXM stack. Modern cloud-based CCM platforms built on open, 'composable' architecture allow easy integration and omnichannel deployment, avoiding

monolithic lock-in. This means your communications platform can seamlessly exchange real-time data and trigger messages in concert with other systems (customer databases, analytics, journey orchestration), delivering consistent messaging across touchpoints.

- Governance, Compliance, and Security: At enterprise scale, governance is paramount. Look for centralized content management and strict oversight controls in a CCM solution. Given rising data privacy concerns and AI ethics regulations, assess how vendors enable AI governance - for example, the ability to use your own trusted AI models and set guardrails. One leading approach by Quadient is 'bring-your-own-AI,' allowing enterprises to plug in their preferred AI services (e.g. Azure OpenAI) via API while controlling usage with admin-defined prompts and usage parameters. This ensures AI features can be leveraged within your corporate security and compliance framework, rather than as a black box.
- Aligning CCM with CX Strategy: Finally, Large enterprises should treat CCM as a core part of the CX and digital transformation agenda, as opposed to an IT refresh. Go beyond simply involving CX and marketing and make CX the owner, with IT as the enabler. A shared communications Center of Excellence (CoE) brings CX, marketing, service, legal, compliance, and IT together so business users can design, test, and improve communications within clear guardrails. In practice, messages triggered by behaviors or lifecycle events should fit naturally into your omnichannel experience, with journey maps that surface sentiment and engagement for continuous improvement. Choose a platform that easily connects to core business systems and offers native intelligent form solutions, so teams and data stay aligned at every step. The result is clearer, more consistent communications that strengthen relationships and raise satisfaction at scale.

# Mid-Market Businesses: Balancing Innovation with Agility and ROI

Mid-sized organizations often have similar customer experience ambitions as large enterprises, but with tighter resources and budgets. For mid-market buyers, the key is to balance cutting-edge capabilities with practicality and ease of deployment.

- Cloud and Agility First: Consider cloud-native CCM platforms that minimize infrastructure hassle and offer fast deployment. Many mid-market firms find value in SaaS models that reduce IT burden while providing scalability on demand. Ensure the platform supports both high-volume batch communications and interactive on-demand generation, so it can grow with your business and handle new use cases as needed. Deployment flexibility (cloud, on-prem, hybrid) is crucial if you have specific data residency or integration requirements, but generally, a managed cloud solution can accelerate your modernization journey without a large upfront investment or burden on limited IT resources.
- Empower Business Users & Reduce IT Dependence: Mid-market teams are often lean, so a CCM solution must empower your non-technical users to do more with less IT intervention. Look for intuitive no-code or low-code design tools that let business users create and update templates and communications themselves. By removing the bottleneck of template changes, you can respond to market or policy changes in days instead of weeks. This agility is crucial for staying competitive. Also evaluate the availability of pre-built templates, content libraries, or industry-specific starter packs that can jump-start your implementation and provide best-practice structures for common documents, a boon for mid-size companies without large content strategy teams.
- Integrated and Composable (Out-of-the-Box): Mid-market organizations might not have extensive integration development capabilities, so ensure the CCM solution plays nicely with your existing software (CRM, core business systems, digital channels) from day one. Modern platforms emphasize interoperability, with robust REST APIs and pre-built connectors that allow real-time data exchange and event-triggered communications. During evaluation, ask vendors how they integrate with popular mid-market systems (for example, Salesforce, Dynamics, core banking or billing systems, etc.) and whether they support composable 'plug-

and-play' integration into a broader customer experience architecture. A wellintegrated CCM will let you automatically personalize communications with your customer data and embed communications into digital workflows, improving customer satisfaction without heavy custom development.

- Cost and Value Assessment: Lastly, mid-market buyers need to keep a close eye on total cost and ROI. Modernizing your CCM yields many benefits, including improved speed, accuracy, and engagement, but be sure the solution aligns with your budget and delivers value quickly. Many organizations discover that the costs of maintaining a patchwork of legacy tools far outweigh the investment in a modern solution, given the savings from efficiency and risk reduction. Still, demand transparency from vendors on pricing (licenses, cloud usage, support) and consider phased implementation to spread costs.

# Public Sector: Ensuring Compliance and Citizen-Centric Modernization

Public agencies must communicate clearly, serve every resident, and protect trust while working with tight budgets and older systems. The objective is a platform that strengthens governance, modernizes safely, and improves the citizen experience without risking continuity of service.

- Prioritize Compliance, Security, and Accessibility: Select a platform that treats governance as a core design principle. Require granular permissions, dual approvals, complete audit trails, records-grade archiving, and strong data protection with encryption and role-based access. Insist on policy-locked language for legal and privacy content, automated checks for disclosures and personal data, and full support for accessibility standards and multilingual publishing.
- Legacy Modernization with Minimal Disruption: Favor solutions that connect to existing systems and allow phased migration. The platform should ingest legacy outputs, rebuild optimized templates with assisted tooling, and run new and old in parallel until confidence is established. This approach reduces risk, shortens delivery time, and preserves critical services while you modernize.

QKS Al Maturity Matrix™

- Citizen Experience and Omnichannel Delivery: Design once and deliver across print, email, SMS, and web channels with consistent policy enforcement. The platform should adapt content to each channel, honor preferences and consent, and keep context when citizens switch channels. Real-time tracking and analytics should feed improvement cycles for clarity, speed, and completion of tasks.
- Strategic Alignment and AI Ethics: Use AI to assist authors, translate content, and triage inquiries under clear controls. Disclose when AI is used, keep humans in the loop for sensitive material, and retain explainability and review for any automated decision. Ensure the platform aligns with your cloud standards, data residency needs, and digital ethics policies to support corporate objectives.

'43 percent of the agencies we assessed still run fragmented tools and manual approvals for communications. Moving from CCM to CXM brings journey orchestration and governed AI into one workspace, shortens change cycles, reduces rework, and eases audits. Omnichannel with preference management lifts completion and lowers avoidable contacts while keeping paper options for inclusivity. The brief for buyers is simple: treat communications as an experience layer connected to events and data, and make governance the first gate. ' -Amandeep Singh, Principal Analyst, QKS Group.

# Outlook 2026-2028: The Future of AI-Orchestrated Experiences

The period from 2026 to 2028 is expected to witness transformative advancements in AI for Customer Communication Management (CCM), effectively pushing the industry fully into the new era of AI-orchestrated experiences. Current innovations like generative AI, journey orchestration, and autonomous agents are poised to become standard features, significantly altering how organizations engage customers and manage communications.

# · 2026 - Generative Communications and AI-Orchestrated Journeys:

By 2026, generative AI will be a mainstream component of CCM. Many organizations will have embedded AI into content creation and personalization, as early movers are already doing. Generative AI is emerging as one of the biggest disruptors in customer communications, with a majority of CXM leaders planning investments to automate and enhance messaging. We at QKS Group anticipate that roughly half of new customer communication processes designed in 2026 will include some form of AI-driven content generation or decision support. Communication design will also be accelerated by AI, where users can describe the desired document or message in natural language and let the system draft templates or text. In parallel, AI-led journey orchestration will become a key capability. Leading CCM vendors are integrating customer journey mapping and real-time analytics into their platforms, enabling bi-directional digital experiences that respond to customer events in real time. In practice, this means that if a process involves sending customer outreach, AI might draft the content and determine the optimal channel and timing, with humans only reviewing in sensitive or exceptional cases. By 2026, most major CCM/CXM platforms will offer built-in generative AI toolkits and journey orchestration features, and teams will grow comfortable collaborating with AI co-creators in their daily workflows.

# · 2027 - Rise of Autonomous Communication Agents:

In 2027, we expect the first wave of true agentic AI capabilities to take hold in customer communications. AI 'communication agents' will begin to autonomously orchestrate complex customer interaction workflows with minimal human oversight. These agentic AI systems can handle decision-making tasks like message timing, channel selection, and personalization on their own. Vendors will

introduce domain-specific communication agents (for example, an AI agent specialized in handling billing inquiries or an onboarding assistant) that manage entire messaging sequences across channels. We at QKS Group foresee that AI agents will routinely manage end-to-end communication scenarios, for instance, an onboarding process might be run by a suite of AIs (one agent gathering customer data via a chatbot, another generating and sending personalized welcome documents, and another monitoring customer responses and triggering follow-ups). Early adopters' success with such autonomous communications will build broader confidence in 2027. Humans will increasingly supervise these AIdriven interactions rather than micromanage each message, intervening only in high-stakes or unusual situations. Industry observers are already highlighting 'intelligent orchestration of customer messages' and optimized campaign management as key use cases for agentic AI. By this time, the distinction between CCM and broader CXM blurs further: communications become an AI-augmented, continuously running conversation, with human teams focusing on strategy, creativity, and governance while AI handles the routine execution.

# · 2028 - Self-Optimizing, Self-Healing Customer Communications:

By 2028, leading organizations will have achieved a fully AI-driven communications ecosystem that is self-optimizing and resilient. CCM platforms, now essentially CXM platforms, will not only execute omnichannel communication, but also constantly learn and adapt those communications in real-time. The system itself will experiment with and discover optimal messaging approaches using techniques like reinforcement learning and multi-variant testing, then implement improvements on the fly without waiting for human-initiated campaign updates. AI-driven analytics already enable optimized send times and real-time decision-making in communications, and by 2028, this will have evolved into closed-loop systems that adjust content and strategy instantly within predefined guardrails. Processes become self-healing as well: if a communication failure occurs (such as a channel outage or a compliance issue), the AI will detect it and immediately reroute or reformulate the message to ensure continuity without manual intervention. With AI handling the granular operational decisions, human oversight shifts to defining goals, brand voice, and governance policies. Decisionmakers will leverage insights from these intelligent communication systems to inform strategy, achieving a tightly knit feedback loop between frontline customer interactions and high-level experience strategy. By this time, the traditional term

'CCM' may give way entirely to a CXM paradigm of orchestrated customer journeys, where personalized, context-aware communication is automatically woven into every step.

Beyond 2028, one can imagine customer communications management evolving into an even more abstract, goal-driven discipline. Organizations might simply specify the desired outcome (for example, improve a customer's onboarding satisfaction or upsell a service to a specific segment), and the AI-driven CXM system will determine how to achieve it by autonomously composing the necessary messages, channels, and interaction steps. In this vision, the AI acts as an autonomous customer experience orchestrator , dynamically assembling communications and processes to meet business objectives - essentially taking the concept of agentic AI to a level where entire communication strategies execute themselves. This goal-oriented orchestration of customer engagement would herald the era of truly self-driving customer communications, bringing us to the threshold of autonomous customer experience management in the years beyond 2028.
