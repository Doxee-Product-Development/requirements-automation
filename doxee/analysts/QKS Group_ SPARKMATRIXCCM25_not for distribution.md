### **Key Findings**

AI is revolutionizing how companies create, personalize, and deliver customer communications, making interactions more relevant, timely, and seamless. Leading vendors like Quadient, Messagepoint, and Smart Communications are already offering AI-powered content automation, hyper-personalization, omnichannel orchestration, and workflow automation.

At the same time, companies like Intense Technologies, Elixir, Doxee, and CSG are actively building strong AI roadmaps, focusing on generative AI, predictive analytics, and self-service automation. These advancements will help businesses enhance engagement, reduce communication friction, and improve customer experience in the coming years. We have identified some key trends happening in the field for CCM.

#### **AI-Generated Content That's Clear and Personalized**

Many companies have already integrated AI into content creation and refinement, ensuring customer communications-whether emails, statements, or service updates are easier to understand and more relevant. AI tools are rewriting complex messages, improving tone, and even auto-generating summaries. Some businesses are actively exploring AI-driven sentiment analysis and compliancebased content filtering to ensure communications remain on-brand, legally compliant, and customer-friendly.

#### **Intelligent Timing for Messages That Matter**

AI-powered real-time personalization is now live in several platforms, helping companies send messages only when customers need them-whether it's a payment reminder, policy update, or promotional offer. Others are in the early stages of deploying predictive AI, experimenting with how customer behavior and interaction history can determine the perfect time and channel to deliver important updates, making communication more effective and less intrusive.

#### **Seamless Customer Conversations Across Channels**

Businesses are either fully implementing or testing AI-powered omnichannel orchestration, which allows customers to switch between chatbots, emails, calls, and social media without losing context. AI ensures that customer interactions are remembered across different platforms, eliminating the frustration of repeating information. Companies that have already rolled this out are seeing higher engagement and better service efficiency, while others are still building AI integrations to unify customer conversations.

#### **AI-Powered Billing & Statements That Explain Themselves**

Some organizations have introduced AI-driven bill explainer tools, making it easier for customers to understand charges, compare past statements, and anticipate changes. Others are in the planning phase of integrating generative AI to autorespond to common billing queries. Instead of a static PDF statement, AI is enabling interactive, dynamic billing experiences, where customers can ask questions and get real-time clarifications.

#### **Smarter Preference Management & Communication Control**

AI-driven preference management is being implemented by several companies, allowing customers to customize when, how, and through which channel they receive updates. Others are working on AI-powered self-service portals that will automate preference settings based on user behavior. The goal is to eliminate unwanted messages while ensuring customers receive the information they actually care about, at the right time, through their preferred communication method.
