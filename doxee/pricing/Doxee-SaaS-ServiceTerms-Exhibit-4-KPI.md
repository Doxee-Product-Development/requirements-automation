## 1. Introduction

This Exhibit 4 to the Service Terms contains the Key Performance Indicators ("KPI") regarding the provision of Software Services as described in the Service Terms and the corresponding Product Data Sheet (Exhibit 2a).

---

## 2. Definitions and Limits

This section describes the objects involved in KPIs definition and their characteristics and limits.

### Paginated Document

A **Paginated Document** is defined as a digital file or artifact generated by the Doxee Platform starting from a flow of data attributable to it. The document represents a finalized business communication such as invoices, statements, or personalized marketing materials. The maximum size per document is expressed in KB and/or number of pages. The standard document has a maximum size of **75 KB** or a maximum of **5 pages**. The mentioned sizing does not take in consideration any external document merged within the document produced by the Doxee Platform.

### Page

**Page** is defined as the single or total number of pages produced following the completion of a production process delegated to the Doxee Platform within the assigned Tier selected by the customer. The standard page has a maximum size of **15 KB**.

### pURL (Personalized URLs)

**pURLs (Personalized URLs)** are secure, unique web links generated by the Doxee Platform to provide targeted access to resources, archived in the Digital Archiving module, such as Doxee Pweb, Doxee Pvideo or PDF files. Each link is unique and identifies a single resource, giving secure and personalized access to the recipient.

### Pvideo and Pweb

**Pvideo** and **Pweb** are personalized, interactive digital formats that enable recipients to access customized videos and web pages. Each format is made up of a data file containing recipient-specific personalization information and template files. These formats are distributed via pURLs, where accesses are tracked as views. Doxee Platform supports up to **10 concurrent views** (10 views/second) per template of Pvideo or Pweb.

### Input File

An **Input File**, in the context of the Doxee Platform, is a data file used as a source for generating documents and communications within batch production processes. These files contain the necessary data and parameters required to execute and complete the production process. In case of a Batch production the customer can submit up to a maximum of **400 input files per day** for processing, with the size of each input file not exceeding **200 MB**.

### On-Demand Input Request

An **On-Demand Input Request**, in the context of the Doxee Platform, is an API document production request of maximum **1 MB** payload used as a source for generating documents and communications within on-demand production processes. This API call contains the necessary data and parameters required to execute and complete the production process.

### Output Lot (Package)

An **Output Lot**, also referred to as a package, in the context of the Doxee Platform, is the final collection of generated documents and communications produced as a result of production processes. It contains the completed documents, ready for delivery through various channels. Each output lot is compiled based on the data and parameters specified in the input files and the production process workflow.

### Batch Production Process

A **Batch Production Process** is defined as a series of sequential steps or activities within the Doxee Platform aimed at generating, processing, and delivering documents. These processes can be automated and may involve data transformation, template rendering, and multi-channel distribution. Every batch process is initiated through the submission of an input file and ends with the production of a package (Output lot) of documents or communications.

Standard performance limits of batch production are:

- Bounded to the specific maximum volume indicated in the Order Form (Exhibit 1a)
- Connection up to **4 distribution channels** (i.e.: e-mail, sms, sftp, print)
- Monthly maximum document production capacity is equal to the annual production limit defined by the volume indicated in the Order Form (Exhibit 1a) divided by 12 months
- Maximum **2 days of production peak** each month
- Maximum **35%** of monthly production volume for each peak day

### On-Demand Production Process

An **On-Demand Production Process** is defined as an informatic production process initiated in response to an immediate or ad-hoc request, typically triggered by user interaction or an external event. Unlike batch processes, on-demand processes are executed as needed rather than in predefined batches. On-Demand production processes are defined by applications where each application is bounded to a single template/layout of document or a single output type. A standard On-demand request is initiated through API (WebService, REST), and ends with the feedback to the request through API.

Standard performance limits of On-demand production are:

- Bounded to the specific maximum volume indicated in the Order Form (Exhibit 1a)
- Connection up to **2 distribution channels** (i.e. e-mail, sms)
- Maximum **3 output types** (3 applications)
- Executions are limited to **3 concurrent requests** with feedback within **5 seconds** for each On-demand application configured

### Interactive Production

**Interactive Production** refers to a dynamic and responsive workflow where a human operator is required to perform specific tasks in real-time or near real-time as part of the production process. In this context, the human agent is actively engaged in executing tasks that necessitate human judgment, decision-making, or intervention, often involving the creation, review, or modification of documents.

### Workflow Step

A **Workflow Step** is defined as a discrete task or action within a document production or business process, represented by a single unit of work that contributes to the overall workflow. Workflow steps can include data manipulation, content generation, approval tasks, or integration with external systems.

### Workflow Execution

A **Workflow Execution** is defined as the completion of a series of workflow steps within a defined timeframe, resulting in the execution of a document production or business process. Each workflow execution represents the end-to-end processing of a set of tasks or activities required to achieve a specific outcome, such as generating a document or completing a customer communication flow.

## 3. KPI Definitions

The Key Performance Indicators are specific to each service (a combination of document type and delivery method) as indicated in the Order Form (Exhibit 1a) and are expressed in different quantities, according to the following:

**Batch Production KPI:**

> KPI = # of Documents or pURLs produced / # hours

**On-Demand Production KPI:**

> KPI = # of concurrent requests / response (document or pURL produced) in seconds

**Interactive Production KPI:**

> KPI = # of human workflow executions / # of hours

**Printing Service:**

> Number of days from receipt of data to completion of physical print out

**Postal Distribution:**

> Number of days from receipt of data to physical delivery

---

## 4. KPI: Batch Production

The Batch Production Target KPI is based on the number of produced Documents or pURLs, as defined in this Exhibit 4 (Definitions and Limits) with file size (expressed in kB), page numbers and limits as their key characteristics, within a specific timeframe in hours.

If the relevant service (Batch Production) is contractually agreed upon, the Software Services will be able to produce the number of Documents or pURLs as set forth by this agreement depending on the type of agreed performance level in the Order Form (Exhibit 1a).

Standard and Premium KPI levels available are listed in **Appendix 1, Table 1** to this Exhibit 4 (KPIs).

For the avoidance of doubt, any production request related to:

- Documents or pURLs that are larger or different with regard to the agreed key characteristics (see Definitions and Limits)
- Process performances that are different with regard to the agreed standard performance limits of Batch Production Process (see Definitions and Limits)

is **not covered** by this KPI. Provider will attempt to reach the requested production goal but is not obligated to meet such goal and is not required to deploy any additional technical or personal resources on the matter.

Customer specific KPI levels are available as an option that do extend production capacity in terms of Documents or pURLs produced and reduces the time required to complete production operations. Such Customer specific KPI levels are subject to additional fees documented by way of the Parties' specific agreement in the Order Form (Exhibit 1a).

---

## 5. KPI: On-Demand Production

The On-Demand production target KPI is based on the number of requests processed within a specific timeframe in seconds to produce a Document or pURL as defined in this Exhibit 4 with file size (expressed in kB) and page numbers as their key characteristics.

Standard and Premium KPI levels available are listed in **Appendix 1, Table 1** to this Exhibit 4 (KPIs).

For the avoidance of doubt, any production request related to:

- Documents or pURLs that are larger or different with regard to the agreed key characteristics (see Definitions and Limits)
- Process performances that are different with regard to the agreed standard performance limits of On-Demand Production Process (see Definitions and Limits)

is **not covered** by this KPI. Provider will attempt to reach the requested goal but is not required to deploy any additional technical or personal resources on the matter and not responsible if the goal is missed.

Customer specific KPI levels are available as an option that do extend production capacity in terms of Documents or pURLs produced and reduces the time required to complete production operations. Such Customer specific KPI levels are subject to additional fees documented by way of the Parties' specific agreement in the Order Form (Exhibit 1a).

---

## 6. KPI: Interactive Production - Human Workflow Executions

The Interactive Production KPI is based on the number of Human Workflow Processes executed per hour with the maximum number of workflow steps per process as defined in this Exhibit 4.

Standard and Premium KPI levels available are listed in **Appendix 1, Table 1** to this Exhibit 4 (KPIs).

For the avoidance of doubt, any request related to:

- Workflow Processes Executions that are larger with regard to the agreed key characteristics (see Definitions and Limits)

is **not subject** to this KPI. Provider will attempt to reach the requested goal but is not required to deploy any additional technical or personal resources on the matter and not responsible if the goal is missed.

---

## 7. KPI: Print Service

The Print Service KPI is based on timing of delivery of the required input data and is expressed in the number of days required to fulfill the printing service.

Standard KPI levels available are listed in **Appendix 1, Table 2** to this Exhibit 4 (KPIs).

The Parties agree that the day of transmission is counted in the term only if the input data is received by Doxee within the time identified in Table 2 of Appendix 1 of this Exhibit; otherwise, the period shall run from the working day following that of receipt.

---

## 8. KPI: Delivery Service

The Delivery Service KPI is based on the type of postal delivery service selected, and is expressed in the number of days required to fulfill the delivery service.

Standard KPI levels available are listed in **Appendix 1, Table 3** to this Exhibit 4 (KPIs).

The Parties agree that the day of transmission is counted in the term only if the input data is received by Doxee within the time identified in Table 2 of Appendix 1 of this Exhibit; otherwise, the period shall run from the working day following that of receipt.
