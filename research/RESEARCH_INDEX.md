## Key Findings Summary

### 1. The Fundamental Shift
**From:** Conversation-centric (humans clarify during sprints)
**To:** Specification-centric (agents need executable context upfront)

**Implication:** "Definition of Ready" must evolve to include visual targets, technical toolsets, executable evals, and context references.

---

### 2. The Bridge Agent Pattern (Most Important)
**Problem:** Bottlenecks in PM → UX → QA → Dev workflow
**Solution:** Four specialized agents remove friction
- UI-Drafter: Scales UX capacity 10x
- Spec-Critic: Catches issues before dev handoff
- Doc-Hunter: Eliminates context archeology
- Eval-Gen: Automates test case writing

**Result:** 2-3x faster spec-to-code time

---

### 3. The Three-Phase Agentic Model
**Phase 0: Strategic Discovery** (NEW)
- Synthetic user validation
- Competitive positioning
- Feasibility estimation

**Phase 1: Agent-Ready Specs**
- Current Speckit `specify` + `clarify`
- Enhanced with bridge agents

**Phase 2: Implementation**
- Current Speckit `plan` + `tasks` + `implement`
- Enhanced with confidence gates

---

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop Placement
**Key Insight:** Humans don't disappear; they shift roles

**Pattern:** Phase gates with confidence thresholds
- Agent generates → Self-evaluates → If confidence < 85% → Escalate to human
- Humans make strategic decisions, agents execute tactical work

---

### 5. Enterprise Non-Negotiables
1. **Audit trails:** Every AI artifact must have metadata (model, version, human approver)
2. **Human-signed requirements:** No AI output goes to production without human approval
3. **Golden Dataset validation:** Test new agent versions against known-good cases
4. **Cost management:** Token budgets with hard limits
5. **Context maintenance:** Dedicated Context Curator role to prevent "context rot"

---

### 6. Known Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)
1. "AI will do everything" fantasy → Keep humans in strategic roles
2. Skip the evals → 30-40% rework rate without validation
3. Prompt engineering over process → Fix process first, then automate
4. Monolithic agents → Break into specialized agents
5. No escalation path → Confidence thresholds are mandatory
6. Ignoring context maintenance → Quality degrades over time

---

### 7. ROI Projections
Based on industry case studies (2024-2026):

**Cycle Time:**
- Before: Idea → Production = 4-6 weeks
- After: Idea → Production = 2-3 weeks
- **Improvement: 50-70% reduction**

**Rework Rate:**
- Without evals: 30-40% of specs require rework
- With evals: <10% rework rate
- **Improvement: 75% reduction in wasted effort**

**Feature Throughput:**
- 1 PM without AI = 1x capacity
- 1 PM with AI = 3x capacity
- **Improvement: 200% productivity gain**

**Cost per Feature:**
- With proper budget controls: $5-10 per feature in AI costs
- Without controls: Can spiral to $50-100
- **Key:** Token budgets are essential
