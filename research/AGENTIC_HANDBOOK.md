# The Doxee Agentic Handbook (2026)
*Transitioning from Agile to Autonomous AI-Driven Software Engineering*

---

## 1. The Vision
Doxee is transitioning from a "Human-Conversation-Centric" Agile model to an **"Agent-Execution-Centric"** model. The goal is to maximize the efficiency of our 35-person development engine by using Agentic AI to bridge human bottlenecks and automate deterministic software tasks.

## 2. Core Role Evolution

| Old Role (Agile) | New Role (Agentic) | Key Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Manager** | **System Orchestrator** | Creating high-fidelity specs with visual targets. |
| **UX Designer** | **Design System Architect** | Maintaining machine-readable component libraries. |
| **QA Engineer** | **Eval Specialist** | Writing machine-executable benchmarks (Gherkin/Evals). |
| **Scrum Master** | **Context Curator** | Managing the RAG Knowledge Base and AgentOps. |
| **Developer** | **HITL Reviewer** | Reviewing Agent-generated PRs and building Tools. |

## 3. The Agentic Development Life Cycle (ADLC)

### Phase 0: Strategic Discovery (Upstream Strategy)
*   **Input:** Raw Business Idea / Market Signal.
*   **Activity:** 
    *   **Competitive Scan:** "Market-Watcher" Agents analyze competitor feature sets/pricing.
    *   **Synthetic Validation:** PM runs the idea against "Persona Agents" (Simulated Users) to test value/pricing.
    *   **Feasibility Check:** PM queries the "Repo-Agent" for rough complexity estimates.
*   **Output:** Validated Business Case & Opportunity Solution Tree (Epics).

### Phase 1: The "Ready" Phase (Discovery)
*   **Input:** Validated Epic from Phase 0.
*   **Activity:** PM + UX + QA collaborate to build a **Spec Package**.
*   **Tools:** AI UI-Drafters (v0), Spec-Critics, and Eval-Generators.
*   **Output:** An "Agent-Ready" specification.

### Phase 2: The "Execution" Phase (Building)
*   **Input:** Agent-Ready Specification.
*   **Activity:** Coding Agents (Cursor, Windsurf, LangGraph) generate code based on the spec.
*   **Review:** Human Developer reviews the "Reasoning Trace" and the PR.
*   **Output:** Verified code branch.

## 4. The Interaction Loops

### The "Agent-Bridged" Loop (Target State)
To solve the **UX Bottleneck** (1 Designer for 35 people), we use utility agents to scale human expertise:

1.  **PM** prompts a **UI-Drafter Agent** to create a mockup.
2.  **UX Designer** reviews and stamps the mockup (Reviewer role vs. Creator role).
3.  **Doc-Hunter Agent** automatically retrieves context for the **Scrum Master**.
4.  **Spec-Critic Agent** validates the requirement against our **Definition of Ready**.

---

## 5. Organizational Standards (DoR)

A requirement is only "Ready" for an Agent when it contains:
1.  **Visual Blueprint:** Screenshot or AI-generated mockup.
2.  **Technical Toolset:** List of existing APIs and UI components.
3.  **Executable Evals:** Given/When/Then scenarios that can run as tests.
4.  **Knowledge Context:** Links to relevant architecture documentation.

---

## 6. Implementation Roadmap
1.  **Phase 1 (Month 1):** Standardize the Specification Template and implement the "Agent-Ready" Checklist.
2.  **Phase 2 (Month 2):** Reskill Scrum Masters into Context Curators and start the Documentation Audit.
3.  **Phase 3 (Month 3):** Launch a Pilot Team using a full Agentic Loop for a selected feature.
